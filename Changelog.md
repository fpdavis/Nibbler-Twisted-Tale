## May 12, 2019 
* Incorporated basic timing into Messagelog. It now shows the miliseconds since the MessageLog was lat called.
* Optional ResetMessageLogTimer() method to reset the timer. 
* Utilities has a method for Benchmarking.
* Joystick support has been started. Reading from controllers is working, just requires the plumbing! 
* Added Loose Tail power up pellet
* Moved animation/image definitions into their own js file. Didn't make it json as the json file I originally
     created was actually harder to edit and read than the js file is. I feel the Music and Sound json files
	 are about as hard as an equivilant js file would be to edit so not much advantage to them. My opinion on
	 this may change if/when we start to load entire levels in from a json file.
